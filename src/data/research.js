  intro:
    'My research interests lie at the intersection of foundation models and real-world intelligence. I am particularly interested in how large language models can be trained, aligned, and deployed to support reasoning, decision-making, and long-horizon interaction.',
  interests: [
    'Post-training alignment (SFT, DPO, PPO, GRPO, preference learning)',
    'Efficient training and adaptation of small and medium-sized language models',
    'Agentic systems with planning, memory, and tool use',
    'Retrieval-augmented generation and hybrid reasoning systems',
    'Evaluation methodologies for alignment, reasoning, and agent behavior',
  ],
  closing:
    'I am especially motivated by research that bridges modeling advances with practical deployment constraints.',
}
